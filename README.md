# Customer_churn_prediction-Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for a business. The project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and performance evaluation to understand the factors leading to customer churn and to build a predictive model that can help in retaining customers.

Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that influence customer churn.
Feature Engineering: Extract and create meaningful features that can improve the model's predictive power.
Model Development: Build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the models' performance using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model for deployment.
